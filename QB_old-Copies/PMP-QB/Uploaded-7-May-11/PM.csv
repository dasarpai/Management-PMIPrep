Ceiling Price = $ 370,000 (Seller will not way more than in any condition)
Share Ratio = 70/20
If actual cost of the project is $320,000 then how much is the profit",,,"[Qno: PML_2949] >> PTA= ((Ceiling Price - Target Price)/buyer&rsquo;s Share Ratio) + Target Cost<BR>
PTA = (370,000 - 350,000) / .7 + 300,000<BR>
PTA = 20,000/.7 + 300,000 = 328,571<BR><BR>

Cost over run @ PTA = 28,571<BR>
Buyer&rsquo;s share (70%) = 20,000<BR>
Seller&rsquo;s share (30%) =  8,571<BR>

Cost up to PTA was agreed to split between the parties<BR>

If the total cost (320,000) is equal to PTA (328,571) then profit <BR> = Target Profit- Seller&rsquo;s Overrun Share<BR>
=50,000 - 8,571 = 41,529<BR>

Because total cost (320,000) is less then the PTA (328,571) <BR>and more than target cost therefore final profit will be $41,529",,,,
