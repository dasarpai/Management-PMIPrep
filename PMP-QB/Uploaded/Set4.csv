What should you do in this situation?",,,"[Qno: PML_2818] >> Project Manager ""Responsibility to maintain and satisfy the scope and objectives of professional services, unless otherwise directed by the customer."" PMP Code of Professional Conduct, if there is any change in the project or product scope, it has to be informed to the customer who can then take an informed decision. So, Option 2 is the best choice. Option 1: The project manager should not change the project requirements or project documents without prior approval of sponsor and customer<BR>Option 4: First the project manager should talk with the customer. Since this is a minor deviation, it may be accepted by the customer. If the customer is not satisfied with the deviation, then the project team should be asked to make changes to the product. Option 3: First the project manager should talk with the customer. Since this is a minor deviation, it may be accepted by the customer. If the customer is not satisfied with the deviation, then a change request has to be opened.",,,,

Radio,SRE,0,1,SingleQuestion,"Your company manufactures cellphones. After 10 million cellphones were sold out in the market, a research team determined that there is a malfunction in the cellphone&rsquo;s batteries which could cause fatal accidents. However, the probability of such accidents happening is very low and one such accident has been reported till now. Replacing of batteries of all the cellphones would be very expensive costing more than $ 50 million. What should your company do FIRST?",,,"[Qno: PML_2820] >> Since there is a probability of fatal accidents, it is ethical to replace all batteries without delay.<BR>Option 1 and option 2 are  unethical options as they are allowing you to wait till some major accident happens. Option 3 should definitely be done but it will not solve the immediate problem therefore this should be done after choice 4.",,,,

You convince your management that you will be able to complete the project in 78 days and completing in 75 days is not possible. How much is the total float on the critical path.,,,[Qno: PML_2825] >> Normally critical path has either zero float or negative float. But if you can compress the complete schedule it means that critical path was having positive float which could be compressed to zero. Having positive float on critical path allows you to negotiate and compress the schedule.,,,,
